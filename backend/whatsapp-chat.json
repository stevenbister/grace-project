Like if you're seeing friends or want alone time that makes sense but it didn't seem that you were bothered?I think because we were drinking and I missed you and it didnt necessarily feel reciprocated I kinda didn't let it go. My past relationships and people I've dated seem to focus on what they want and what use i have. It just makes me really question what people think/feel about me.
